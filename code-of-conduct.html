          <h1 class="title">Code of Conduct</h1>
          <p>
            AwesomeConf is dedicated to providing a harassment-free conference
            experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and
            expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical
            appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, religion (or lack thereof),
            or technology choices. We do not tolerate harassment of conference
            participants in any form. Sexual language and imagery is not
            appropriate for any conference venue, including talks, workshops,
            parties, Twitter and other online media. Conference participants
            violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the
            conference without a refund at the discretion of the conference
            organizers.
          </p>
          <p>
            Please treat your fellow AwesomeConf participants with respect,
            regardless of the context you’re interacting with them.
          </p>
          <p>
            Harassment is not appropriate for any conference venue. We expect
            all AwesomeConf participants to follow the Code of Conduct during
            the conference. This includes conference-related social events at
            off-site locations, and in related online communities and social
            media. Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are
            expected to comply immediately. Conference participants violating
            this Code of Conduct may be expelled from the conference without a
            refund, and/or banned from future AwesomeConf events, at the
            discretion of AwesomeConf
          </p>
          <p>
            Examples of harassment include offensive comments, verbal threats or
            demands, sexualized images or language in public spaces,
            intimidation, stalking, harassing photography or recording,
            sustained disruption of sessions or events, and unwelcome physical
            contact or sexual attention. Speaker presentations fall under this
            category and should not use images or examples that would violate
            the code of conduct. AwesomeConf participants must remember that
            AwesomeConf organizers and volunteers are not trained conflict
            resolution specialists, nor are they security or law enforcement.
            AwesomeConf organizers and volunteers will immediately escalate
            issues around safety, violence, or similar situations to event venue
            staff or law enforcement. For the protection of AwesomeConf
            participants, AwesomeConf will never put its organizers or
            volunteers in the position of trying to assess whether or not an
            incident merits escalation. If there is any doubt, we will escalate
            incidents to the appropriate agency immediately.
          </p>

          <h2>Incident Resolution</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>
              All AwesomeConf participants agree to treat each other with
              respect, regardless of whether you are in a session room or at the
              event venue facilities.
            </li>
            <li>
              Simple disagreements should be resolved between the individuals
              concerned.
            </li>
            <li>
              Harassment or more serious issues should be escalated to a
              AwesomeConf organizer or volunteer. That person will immediately
              contact a AwesomeConf Board member who has the responsibility to
              assist in resolution.
            </li>
            <li>
              AwesomeConf participants suffering outright assault or extreme
              harassment should contact the event venue staff immediately, or a
              AwesomeConf organizer if they're nearby. That person will
              immediately escalate the issue to the event venue staff or law
              enforcement as appropriate.
